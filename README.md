# monkey-scripts
This is a collection of scripts for Tampermonkey.
## Google Redirect Notice.user.js
When clicking links in Google Calendar, for security reasons you get a manual
redirection page. As this is ridiculous when you are the only user creating
events, this script auto-skips the redirection page.
## Heise Onepage.user.js, ZON Onepage.user.js
Since I'm quite able to use vertical scrollbars, I prefer reading articles on
one page. These scripts auto-click the respective "on one page" links.
## Heise Topper.user.js, Leo.org Topper.user.js
From some websites I remove some space wasting header elements. If the content
area is on an absolut position, it may leave unused space at the top of the
page. The topper-scripts move the content areas upwards.
## deprecated-Folder
Contains some scripts I no longer use but which may come handy when a page
changes its behaviour.
